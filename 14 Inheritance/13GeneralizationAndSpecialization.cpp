/*
Purpose of Inheritance are 2 basic things : Sharing features to child classes and second is to achieve polymorphism.
Generalization Vs Specialization
class Rectangle
class Cuboid:Rectangle
specialized class is cuboid as it is derived from rectangle and both exist in real world
Example
class Innova
class Fortuner
fortuner car is extension of innova and both exist in real world
Specialization is top down approach as first rectangle was existing then cuboid exist
Here base class have functions,parameters to give to child class
purpose of specialization is to share its feature to child class


class Shape
 Rectangle circle Quadrilateral
shape does not exist in real world thus shape is generalization

class Car
 Innova Swift Corella
 car does not exist it is generalised word for all four wheelers
Generalization is bottom down approach as first innova swift etc was exist then we defined this term car common for all
Here base class doesnt have anything to give to child class, their purpose is to group them together
purpose of generalization is to acheive polymorphism 
Same word car we are using for different objects this is polymorphism
