class Parent

Function overriding is redefining of function of base class in derived class 

int main()
{
    Parent p;
    p.display(); //display of parent
    Child c;
    c.display(); //display of child     as display is redefined this is function overriding
    return 0;
}



Example 
I have a car design and you have borrowed it from me 
features of my car are available in your car too and you are redefining it this is function overriding 
just example in my car we have a key to unlock the car but in your car you have sensor to unlock the car
