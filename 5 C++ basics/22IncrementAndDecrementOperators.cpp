/* increment opeator
pre increment
++x;
post increment
x++;
DEcrement operator
pre decrement
--x;
post decrement
x--;
example
i = i +1 or i+=1; or i++ or ++i; all these mean the same just imcrease i  by 1;

more useful examples
int x=5, y;
y = ++x;   // here y will be 6 and x also be 6 as name suggests pre increment 
y = x++; // here y will be 5 and x will be 6 as name suggests post increment

more examples:
int x=4,y=5,z;
z = x++ * y; // here x will be 5 and z will be 20 as it is post increment operator
z = ++x * y; // here x will be 5 and z will be 25 as it is pre increment operator
