/* CPU - 1 ALU
         2 Cu
ALU = Arithmatic and Logical unit =arithmatic and logical operations is done by this part like + - * / < > = And or Not
CU = Control unit  = its job is to control all other resources like HDD input output

HDD
it will contain some files which may be program files or data files  
example- music files are data files and music player is program file

Main memory if need to read something then it will take it from input buffer
or if need to present something to user then will give to output buffer to print it to output(monitor)


computer works on binary number system(0 or 1)
8 bit = 1byte
but we understand decimal number system(0 1 2 3 4....9)
