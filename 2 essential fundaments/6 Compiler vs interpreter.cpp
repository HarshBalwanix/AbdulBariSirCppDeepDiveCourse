/* Some high level languages are compiler based and some are interpreter based
task of compiler or interpreter
1 check errors 
2 convert into ML
3 execution of program(runnnig of a program)
compiler is not involved in execution of program  but interpreter is.
c++ is compiler based language and javascript is interpreter based language
translation of program is done only once by compiler and it will generate an exe file but execution is not done by compiler
commpiler will stop if there is error in any line
chrome works as a interpreter of javascript
chrome will execute javascript program 
chrome will translate  the code line by line and will execute it along together.
interpreter will translate as well as execute it too.
interpreter will not create a exe file.
interpreter will not stop if there is some error in any line. It wil translate and execute till that faulty line.
compiled programs are faster then interpreted programs
interpreted languages are easier than compiled languages
ex-
preparing a chinese dish 
i dont know chinese but my friend knows.
two ways 
1 he will translate in english and give it to me totally together then i will prepare the dish and can work independently.(compiler)
2 He will translate step by step and i will perform the steps as well and cant work independently.(interpreter)


Hybrid languages=
->partial compilation
compiler will convert into byte code after checking errors then interpreter convert it into ML
example- Java(JVM is interpreter for java), C#
