/*
3 types of errors occur in program
    1 Syntax error (compiler helps) //faced by programer
    2 Logical error (Debugger helps) //faced by programer
    3 Runtime error  ()  //faced by user
        Reasons of Runtime error
        1 bad input
        2 problem with resources 
program crashes in this type of errors

For example 
when we own a car, we are responsible for taking care of it.as if we didnt give it engine oil it will stop working.
or if we fill water in place of oil, it will not work..these are runtime errors
but just like car indicates the problem, program should also behave like this. 
These runtime errors are called as Exception.
program should indicate user what the problem is and also provide solution to it.
