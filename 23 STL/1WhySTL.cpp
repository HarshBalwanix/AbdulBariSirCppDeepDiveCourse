 /*
Why do we need STL?
we need DS for storing collection of data or it is arranging of data
example 
int array[10]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}; this is collection of data and we can do a lot with it
we can not increase the size of this array after making it 
so we have a logic
we can create a new size array with bigger size and we can copy all the elements
array=new int[20];
