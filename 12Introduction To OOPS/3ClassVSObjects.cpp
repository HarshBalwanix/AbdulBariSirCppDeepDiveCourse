/*
Class Vs Objects
class is coming from classification 
like students and employees are classes
and human and animals are classes
class Human
           object-You
                 -Me
class Car 
           object-BMW
                 -TOYOTA
class is just like blueprint and object is made using class
For example
class will contain data which is called as properties and function which is called as behaviour
class Rectangle;
{
    //data
    float length,breadth;
    float area();
    float perimeter();
    float diagonal();
}
//object
Rectangle r1,r2,r3;
