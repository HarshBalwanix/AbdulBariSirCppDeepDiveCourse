/*
1 Abstraction
2 Encapsulation
  *data hiding
3 Inheritance
4 Polymorphism

two main elements of programming
1 Data
2 Functions


Abstraction
we dont want to see the implementation of function or how they are working but we want name of  functions
example-
while we are using a car we dont need to understand its mechanism
example-
print f function we dont know how it is working 
Encapsulation
to make data safe from mishandling we hide it and make it private 
and we make function as public 
this is encapsulation
Example-
In a car everything is hidden inside only the dashboard stering and all other functions are coming out  
Inheritance
suppose we have written a class1 and with some changes another class2 which include all the features of class 1 and some extra features too then this is inheritance
For example- 
we have a class Car
BMW SUZUKI TOYOTA all are cars and have all the features of class Car along with some extra features 
Polymorphism
With the help of inheritance we achieve polymorphism
if we know all the features of upper class we not need to know the features of lower sub class
this is polymorphism 
example 
if we know how to drive a car we can drive BMW SUZUKI TOYOTA and all. this is polymorphism
