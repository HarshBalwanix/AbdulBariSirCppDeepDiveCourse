/*
With the help of dynamic declaration we can utilise the memory efficiently 
C++ allows declaration of variable wherever you like
for eg 
int a;
if(int k=exp, k<a) // we can declare k here and it will work for this bracket only, outside this bracket this k will be a unknown variable
{

}
cout<<k<<endl; // k is unknown variable here so it will display error
